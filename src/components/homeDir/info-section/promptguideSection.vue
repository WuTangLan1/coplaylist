    <h1>How to Provide Effective Inputs</h1>
    <p>Getting the most out of CoPlaylist depends on how well the system understands your musical preferences. Here’s how you can provide effective inputs:</p>
    
    <h2>1. Selecting Genres and Eras</h2>
    <p>Choose genres and eras that you feel most resonate with your current mood or the atmosphere you wish to create. Selecting a diverse range of genres and eras can help the system discover and blend a wider array of music that still aligns with your tastes.</p>
    
    <h2>2. Defining Vibes</h2>
    <p>Vibes are crucial for setting the tone of your playlist. Think about what you are currently doing or how you want to feel while listening to your playlist. Whether you’re looking to relax or energize yourself, selecting the appropriate vibe can greatly influence the playlist’s direction.</p>
    
    <h2>3. Activities and Settings</h2>
    <p>Link your music to specific activities or settings (like studying, working out, or a quiet evening) to get playlists that enhance those experiences. This contextual information helps the system tailor its selections more accurately.</p>
    
    <h2>4. Song Preferences</h2>
    <p>While the system won’t include these songs directly in your playlists, mentioning a few of your favorite songs helps establish a baseline for your tastes. This is especially useful for discovering new music with similar vibes or elements.</p>
    
    <h2>5. Using the Feedback System</h2>
    <p>After listening to the playlists, rate them. This feedback is invaluable for refining future playlists. The more you interact with the rating system, the better CoPlaylist becomes at predicting what you’ll love.</p>
    
    <p>By carefully selecting each input and regularly updating your preferences, you can continually enhance the personalization of your playlists. Enjoy a musical experience that is uniquely yours!</p>
